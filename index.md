## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the University of Central Florida, advised by Dr. Mubarak Shah, and a Fulbright Ph.D. Scholar.

My research lies at the intersection of vision–language models, AI safety, and robust representation learning. I focus on improving the safety, interpretability, and generalization of large pre-trained multimodal models, with particular emphasis on NSFW content mitigation, zero-shot learning, and robustness under distribution shift.

I have also worked on video understanding and biometric recognition problems in large-scale, real-world settings, including government-funded research projects. My goal is to develop principled methods that make vision–language systems more reliable and deployable in safety-critical applications.
