## About Me

I am a **Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the University of Central Florida**, advised by **Dr. Mubarak Shah**.  
I am a **Fulbright Scholar**, and my research focuses on **vision–language models**, **AI safety**, and **robust representation learning**.

My work studies how to improve the **safety, interpretability, and generalization** of large pre-trained vision–language models, with applications to **content moderation** and **video understanding**.
